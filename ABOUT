sysmon3 (pronounced sys-mon-three) is a follow on to sysmon-qt.

This is a part of a client/server process.  The server is sysmond and is
required to be running on the monitored system for sysmon3 to work.

The program is based on Qt (either qt5 or qt6).  It allows for setup and
configuration of a small window in a graphical environment to monitor a
system's critical running parameters:

Hostname
Time
Date
Uptime
CPU Load (1, 5, 15 minute readings)
A progress bar with percent of CPU (all cores) usage
A progress bar with percent of memory usage
System temperature sensors

These values are determined by the server's sysmond server process and sent to
the client when requested.

The main process runs in a loop, once a second, where is sends a UDP request to
the server and receives all values as a response.  The client then parses then
response and desplays the items desired. The loop time is not currently
configurable.

When setting up the host to be monitored, the system needs to find the IP
address of the server.  One element of the response is the hostname. This can
be a little confusing.  If the host is accessed by www.example.org, but the
hosts name is 'mercury', then the setup requires www.example.org to be
specified, but the top line will display 'mercury' as the host name.

The source code is written it provide a reaonably well documented example of a
non-trivial application based on Qt.  The source is about 2700 lines of C++
code divided into 17 files.
